Plan and implement a feature: $ARGUMENTS

**Phase 1 — Plan** (present before implementing):
1. Check docs/PARKING_LOT.md for existing plans
2. Read relevant source files
3. Check docs/adr/ for architectural constraints
4. Present: files to change, DB schema changes, test strategy, risks

**Phase 2 — Implement** (after approval):
1. Implement following existing patterns
2. Write tests (mock external deps)
3. Run full test suite
4. Update docs if needed

Rules: no real YouTube calls, schema changes need migration in storage.py, new public functions need docstrings.
