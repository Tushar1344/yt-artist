Add an item to the parking lot: $ARGUMENTS

**Step 1 — Read** docs/PARKING_LOT.md to find the current last item number and the priority sections.

**Step 2 — Determine priority** from context:
- **P0** — Blocks usability or trust
- **P1** — Significant user value
- **P2** — Quality of life
- **P3** — Future vision

If unclear from $ARGUMENTS, ask before proceeding.

**Step 3 — Add the item** under the correct priority section using this format:
```markdown
### <next number>. <title> `[<source>]`
**Why:** <1-2 sentences explaining the motivation>

**Scope:**
<Bullet points describing what needs to happen>

**Effort:** <Tiny | Small | Small-medium | Medium | Large>. <One sentence justification.>

---
```

Source tag: `[user requested]` if the user asked for it, `[suggestion]` if identified during review.

**Step 4 — Verify** the numbering is sequential and the item is under the right priority heading.
