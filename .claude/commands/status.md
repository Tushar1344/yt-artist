Review project status (no tests — use /test for that):

1. `git status` and `git log --oneline -5`
2. Count source files in src/yt_artist/ and test files in tests/
3. Check if ruff is installed
4. Read docs/PARKING_LOT.md for pending work items

Format: branch, last 5 commits (one line each), file counts, top 3 parking lot items.
