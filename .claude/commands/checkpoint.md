Create a knowledge checkpoint before major changes.

1. Summarize current session work so far
2. Run /project:memory-update to sync CLAUDE.md
3. Update docs/SESSION_SUMMARY.md with:
   - What was done this session
   - Key decisions made
   - Open questions or blockers
4. Stage and show a `git diff --stat` summary
5. Ask if user wants to commit the checkpoint

Use this before large refactors or when context is getting long.
